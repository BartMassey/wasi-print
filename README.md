# wasi-print: implementation of Rust print macros and similar for no_std WASI
Bart Massey 2023

This crate contains basic niceties for writing `no_std`
modules for [WASI](https://wasi.dev/). `wasi-print` provides:

* An `abort()` function that raises a WASI exception.
* A `panic_handler` that aborts after trying to print panic information.
* A `print_fd()` function that prints an `&str` to a WASI `fd`.
* Printing macros `print!()`, `println!()`, `!eprint()` and `!eprintln()`.

## Example

This is a full standalone Rust WASM program using
`wasi_print`.

```rust
#![no_std]

use wasi_print::*;

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn math_add(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
    eprint!("guest running math_add({}, {}) â€¦", x, y);
    let result = x + y;
    eprintln!(" and returning {}", result);
    result
}
```
